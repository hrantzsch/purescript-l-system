# Purescript L-System

Creating [L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) with Purescript, using purescript-drawing for drawing and purescript-flare for controls.

This is just a toy project. I implemented three example instances from the Wikipedia article: the fractal tree, the Sierpinski triangle, and the fractal plant.
I think the plant is the coolest, so you can try it out here: https://hrantzsch.github.io/purescript-l-system/index.html.
